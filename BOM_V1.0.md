Here's some helpful links for the keypad: https://learn.adafruit.com/matrix-keypad/overview
3x4 keypad -- input and can also serve as way for users to start new game (press #)
Potentiometer + knob -- input
large button -- input

Should be able to find simple circuit to operate 
speaker -- audio output and user cues
Maybe 3 different 555 timer circuits to connect to speaker and play different sounds -- create different audio signals with varying tones (high, medium, low tone)


Helpful link for info about LCD Display: https://www.makerguides.com/character-lcd-arduino-tutorial/
16X2 LCD Display -- keep score & also could notify user of type it code if display has enough space
10k Potentiometer -- for tuning the contrast of the display
For testing on breadboard it might be helpful to order 1x16 header pins to solder to LCD display and then easily connect to breadboard -- maybe
